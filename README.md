# hello-world
My first repo in git, where I will be storing ideas for future developments

This looks like a great way to code multiple ideas at the same time and a necessary tool to work on the same software code with colleagues.
It will take me some time to get used to the possibilities of branching but I start to see the relevance of git, even when coding alone.

<b> does html work here?</b> <i>wow!</i>
